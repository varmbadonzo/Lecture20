            I sat the University of Liberia entrance right after taking my National exam in 2012. The result was<br />
            was yet to be out. <br />
            I did not really want to sit the<span class="vname"> University Entrance</span>, but my instructor at the time called Mr. Ibrahim <br />
            Manir from Nigeria encourage me to even tho he had promised me to take me to Nigeria to countinue my education.<br />
            He said to me that whenever you are looking for opportunity, do not negelect any means  of apply for more than once <br />
            options. I listened to him and I sat the entrance and passed.<br />
            How did I know that I pass the National exam? One of my brothers called Mohammed Donzo sat the entrance also<br />
            and when he heard of the result, he asked one of my brothers called Iderissa F Donzo to check his result for him<br />
            While on his way he asked me to join him and I was hesistant of going because we were told by then you can not take<br />
            the entrance once and passed. But I however accompanied him to the campus. While on the campus, we paid to check up his <br />
            While looking for his name, I fortunitely found my name in the as one of the successful candiates. What a joyful moment<br />
            My instructor however adhered to his promise but my parents did not allow me to go. All this happened before the openning<br />
            of the semester. I later submitted my required documents at the University for admission and I was admitted and <br />
            started classed. My first semester, I had a GPA of 3.588 and I was given a scholarship the following semester<br />
            My schooling at the University of Liberia was interrupted by the outbreak of the deadly EBOLA VIRUS in 2014. <br />
            After the outbreak, I did not go back there again and decided to change my school due to some life changelling <br />
            problems.
