        <h1>The journey of Destiny</h1>
        <p id="us">
            I started schooling in <span class="vname">Kouankan  Refugee School at the age of sixteen(16yrs) in 2003 amid the critical time of my life as a sick patient<br />
            Despite the sickness, I managed to dux the section that I was in with 94% average. I was given a double promotion to the third grade the following year.<br />
            I did not accept the double promotion that year due to some advices from family memebers. I maintained the second grade class the following year and I also <br />
            dux the school with ninty seven point two(97.2 average) at the same school in Guinea and I was given a double promotion. My mother then managed to send for me<br />
            thorugh one of my big sisters called sis Fatu Nyei.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            I arrived in Monrovia in 2004 and I there after took an entrance at a school called Africa Islamic Center School<br />
             located in Jacob Town, Monrovia. I passed the entrance and I was admitted in the same years I accepted the promotion<br />
            that was given me from Guinea. I managed to dux the school again in the forth grade and I was given a promotion<br />
            at the end of the first semester. And at the end of the school year, I was promoted to the six grade class. I then asked<br />
            my mother to allow me live with my big sister in super market and my request was granted and I started living with them.<br />
               
        </p>
        <p id="us">
            Whil in supermarket, I took an entrance for the six grade class at a school called Seku Ibrahim Sheriff, elementary and <br />
            Junior high school located in JJY Super Marker Gardnersville and I passed the entrance and I was also admitted . I started<br />
            schooling that in(2006). Based on my performance and according to the school hand book that year, any student attaining the average<br />
            85% and above will be promoted at the end of the first semester of the school and year. And my average at the end of the semester was around<br />
            90%, I cannot remember exactly. But the vice principal at the time called me in his office and inofrm me that I was qualify to sit the <br />
            the National exam with the ninhth graders and that I should inform my parents of the fees and I did and it did not materialize due to reason<br />
            to reason that I do not know. Actually I made some error in this explaination. This promotion issue came about after completing the six, and<br />
            seven and while in the eighth grade, that was when my vice principal asked me to inform my parents of my promotion to the next level and it turned <br />
            to be a dispointment to me. After spending three years in that school, completing the eight grade class and duxing my class until I finally dux the<br />
            the school in the eight grade . I was given a scholarship that year by the school administration and I decided to change my school to attend the Booker<br />
            Washington Institute in Kakata.<br />
             
        </p>
        <p>
            My decission to attend the Booker Washington Institute was greatly influenced by one of my big sisters son called Blama Sheriff. He encorage me to atted the<br />
            school because he was attedding there. My first semester at the Booker Washington Institute was a changelling one financially and academically. But as God could<br />
            have it, one of my brothers by the name of Abu S. Kromah agreed to sponsor me through out my stay at the dorm. I when underoll the first semester and my family organized<br />
            a little celebration for me in Kakata Margibi county. I spent four solid year at BWI and I graduated in september 15, 2012.<br />
            Hoever, but graduating from BWI we had a catastrophe during our junior year and the dorm in was in burnt down . Below is a picture of the dorm on fire.<br />
