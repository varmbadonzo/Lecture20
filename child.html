            My name is<span class="vname"> varmba F. Donzo</span> and I was born on the 15 of August, 1987<br />
            in Kolahun, Lofa County, Liberia.<br />
            My parents are Alahaji Lassana Fofana(the late) and Matalee K. Fofana.<br />
            Both of my grand parents are deceased.The bothe of them died when I was an <br />
            infan. I spent my earlier childhood life in a refugee camp in Guinea where we <br />
            use to go and beg for food and eat left over food in cookshops with my borther<br />
            who is dead now. This was seen to us to be a good life by then as a child <br>
            comming up with life . We enjoy that as we did until it is now that I know that<br />
            it was not a life to live as a person. May the Almighty Allah save me from such a deeming<br />
            experience. Amen.<br />
            My father use to take coffee garder from people as a contract for the family to brush<br />
            to brush. He did that for several years and he was once granted a lot to farm on<br />
            farm. He later returned home(Liberia) after the war ceased a little bit with some of <br />
            family members and leaving us there with our mother to follow later. We spent some times<br>
            there and later followed him. I did not stay too long and my father arranged and sent me <br />
            to my aunt who was married to a Karmoh(teacher) who resideded in Guinea at the time but<br />
            was a Liberian.

        <p id="us"> I spent part of  my earlier childhood life in Guinea where my father had sent me to learn<br />
             
            Quran in 1997. I was there upto the outbreak of the second Liberian civil war<br />
            that ended in 2003. My karmoh(teacher) died in 2000. and I ended in the hands<br />
            of his brother. After the outbreak of the war, my father along with some <br />
            family member managed to move to<span class="vname"> Guinea</span>span> in exile(Kouankan Refugee camp)<br />
            I clamax that whole experience with a severe sickness that lasted for about<br />
            nine years, untile when I was opportuned to reach one of my big sisters husband in <br />
            Monrovia, Liberia. I lived with him for several years and he gave me the necessary<br />
            support I needed in life. He actually served as a father for me in his life time until<br />
            until he passed off. He sent me to a karmoh who did several things for me and I <br />
            was later taken to a hospital by one of my aunt. I went through several <br />
            testing and my case could not just be diagnosed as it happed in the past.<br />
            The doctor finally decided to place me on a treatment based on the case we <br />
            and I believed it was the right treatment for me. I took that medication<br />
            for nine minth with the assistence of my mom who use to go for the medicine for <br />
            and  it actually brough a great relief to me healthwise.
            Below is a picture of my sister who I lived with and her husband in Monrovia.<br />
